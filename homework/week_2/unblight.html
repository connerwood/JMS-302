        <h1>Unblight Macon</h1>
        <p>Macon, GA hosted an unconference (an organic conference where attendees do most of the talking) August 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>on housing blight in Macon. It brought members of the community together for a central purpose-to talk about ways to measure blight in hopes of one day reducing it.<br/>According to an article written by the <i>Telegraph</i>, Mayor Robert Reichert said, <q>It's hard to raise children up right in a dilapidated neighborhood...it breaks the spirit.</q></p>
